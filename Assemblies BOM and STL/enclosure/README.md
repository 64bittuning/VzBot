# Recommended nuts for pannels and trimms are spring loaded tnuts. It makes it WAY easier if the nut stays in place while assembling.

- Aluminum panels need M4 8mm and t-nuts (about 20 to be safe + hardware for hinges, feet, and power switch)
- Acyrylic panels need M3 10mm and t-nuts (about 64 total. 70 to be safe)
