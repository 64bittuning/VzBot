Use this template drille the PSU holes. Pay attention to the L and R mark on the STL. The STL is used for both sides. Just reverse it.

L goes on the left side when facing the rear of the printer. R goes to right side.

If you back plate has the 2020 mounting holes, use them to align the drilling template. If you don't have those hose, pleace the template at 135mm from the bottom of the back plate
