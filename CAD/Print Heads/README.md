Printed head asemblies.

The Print head is a modified EVA carriage to fit the VzBoT. The EVA project is owned and maintained by Pawel. Big thanks and credits to the man behind this.

If you wish to encourage Pawel to continue developping the EVA: https://contrib.eva-3d.page

Note: Difference between MGN12 and MGN9 is only the TOP part of EVA, so one could just change the TOP. That is the only difference in the CAD models.
